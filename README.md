This is my blog, where I host all my wasm based projects and talk about technical stuff sometimes.

You can also play my current development build for my game 'Panzatier' on the start page.

This is a simple Tower and Axum based web server, using the popular Frontend lib HTMX for some reactivity.
It includes some custom click tracking with Sqlite and mail forms.

It's my own framework based on Htmx Components.

Hosting is done inside a docker container on a cheap, plain Linux machine with a nginx proxy.
