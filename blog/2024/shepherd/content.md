# My entry to the Bevy Game Jam #4

From time to time I really enjoy working under pressure. In the recent bevy jam #4
you were given 1 week and a theme to finish a game from zero. In this case the theme
was 'A lot of entities'. This was my submission.

## About the game

The game is called 'Shepherd's Quest.' It's an easy game where your job is to lead sheep to
the finish line of each stage.

For the game jam, the rule was simple: you could use any asset
as long as they were self-made or open source. This made things a bit tricky creatively.

There were only a few free designs for sheep and dogs available, and the only bundle with animations
had a pug for a dog.

So, I decided to make the pug a key character in the game.

In the game, you play as a pug named Henk who wants to be a sheep herder, but no one believes
he can do it because he's a pug. That is until a mysterious herder comes along and gives Henk a chance to prove himself.

The code is open source and available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Lommix/shepherds_quest).
